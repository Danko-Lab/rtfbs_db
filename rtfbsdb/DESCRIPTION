Description: This package finds the transcription factor binding sites within specified genome loci and estimate the enrichment between two case-control group of different genomic loci based on a scoring algorithm driven by a Hidden Markov model and the CisBP database (or other data source, such as Jaspar, Transfac). It clusters motifs with similar DNA sequence specificities and optionally integrates RNA-seq or PRO-seq data to restrict analyses to motifs recognized by TFs expressed in the cell type of interest. PDF report is provided for the motif clustering, tfbs scaning and enrichment test.
